Those who have dedicated themselves to this emphasis of Ki have learned to manipulate the very elements. By doing so they have managed to learn to control their own Ki to a greater degree. While the monks who dedicate themselves to this emphasis of Ki are still quite adept in physical combat, much more of their focus is dedicated to spellcraft than any other emphasis, and they have learned how to manipulate ki to create some potent elemental effects.
